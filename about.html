                    <span class="paragraph">"The Church of God Kallumala has a rich and storied history rooted in the
                        broader Pentecostal movement that swept through Kerala, India, in the early 20th century. This
                        church, like many others in the region, was born out of a fervent desire for spiritual renewal
                        and a deep commitment to the teachings of Pentecostalism, emphasizing the importance of the Holy
                        Spirit's gifts and the personal experience of God's presence.

                        Founded in Kallumala, a region known for its vibrant Christian community, the church initially
                        served as a small congregation of believers who were passionate about spreading the Gospel and
                        living out their faith in a tangible way. Over the years, The Church of God Kallumala grew in
                        both size and influence, becoming a spiritual home for many in the community. The church's
                        leadership, often drawn from local families with strong religious convictions, played a crucial
                        role in shaping its doctrines and outreach programs.

                        Throughout its history, the church has been involved in various social and charitable
                        activities, reflecting its commitment to holistic ministry—addressing both spiritual and
                        physical needs. The Church of God Kallumala has also been known for its dynamic worship
                        services, vibrant youth programs, and a strong emphasis on Biblical teaching.

                        As part of a larger network of Pentecostal churches in Kerala, The Church of God Kallumala has
                        contributed to the spread of Pentecostalism in the region, influencing the faith journey of many
                        believers. Today, it stands as a testament to the enduring power of faith and community,
                        continuing to serve as a beacon of hope and spiritual guidance in the Kallumala area.</span>

                            years. Looking back at
                            the history of 50 years, there is not enough time to write and words to say... God did it
                            and
                            thank God. Born and raised in the Jacobite tradition, it was difficult for me to accept and
                            follow the truths of the Pentecostal faith.In the 70s, divine visitations came to the house
                            and
                            Thankachan became ill. When medicine and mantras failed, prayer groups were sought for
                            refuge.
                            Through the prayers initiated by Nainachaya, God granted deliverances. On this occasion,
                            Priya
                            Nainachayan is remembered with gratitude. It was Nainachayan who tried to cooperate with
                            Kallumala Kunjumonachayan. When everyone gave up, we were left alone with 3 children and had
                            to
                            leave home for the sake of faith. In this context, let us remember some of the servants of
                            God
                            who taught us the word that kept us firm in the faith in the early days. Can't forget Rani
                            Kunjumon (Anjani) who taught the word of God, Chandapilla sir came with him and kept him
                            fasting. When we started praying at home, we experienced a lot of adversity from our
                            neighbors
                            and relatives. God has maintained it until today. We gratefully remember all the servants of
                            God
                            who have ministered to Itti Thanam Church since its inception. Pastor James and Pastor
                            Pappachan's services cannot be forgotten. Gratefully remember all those who ministered to
                            God's
                            church and families with faith even in a position where there was nothing financially. After
                            the
                            death of Kallumala Kunjumonchayan, some of the unspiritual ambitions for position in the
                            churches are known.

                            Praying that God will take over the leadership of the church going forward. So far the
                            living
                            God gives life and strength. There is weariness of age, loss of memory and weakness. All our
                            3
                            children are in USA and have been living with them for the past 20 years. Special thanks to
                            all
                            the believers of Ititthanam Church and God's servant. Although unable to attend our church's
                            50th anniversary, we remember everyone in our prayers. All will come, live your life
                            according
                            to God's word, may God help you to inherit eternity and remain faithful to the Lord until
                            death.
                            God bless the church. Wish you all the best. Pray for us too</span>
